# C++ Introduction Part-1

## What is Programming?

 **Programming**  is the process of giving instructions to a computer to solve a problem or perform a task.

A computer itself is dumb—it only understands  **machine-level instructions** . Programming languages act as a  **bridge between human logic and machine execution** .

📌  **Real-life analogy** 
Think of programming like giving step-by-step cooking instructions.
If steps are wrong or unclear → dish fails.
Same with programs.

## What is C++?

 **C++**  is a  **general-purpose programming language**  developed by  **Bjarne Stroustrup**  as an extension of the C language.

It combines:

- Speed of low-level languages
- Abstraction of high-level languages
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

📌  **Why C++ still matters** 

- Gives full control over memory
- Extremely fast execution
- Used where performance is critical

---

## Features of C++

- High Performance (close to hardware)
- Object-Oriented (classes, objects, inheritance)
- Supports Procedural + OOP
- Manual Memory Control
- STL (Standard Template Library)

---

## Where is C++ Used?

### 🔹 Placements & Interviews

- Strong base language for DSA
- Common in product-based companies

### 🔹 Competitive Programming

- Fast I/O
- STL makes problem solving efficient

### 🔹 System Software

- Operating Systems
- Game Engines
- Compilers
- Databases

## How C++ Code Runs

## Structure of a C++ Program

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello World";
    return 0;
}

```
### Output
Hello World

## Breakdown

🔹  `#include <iostream>` 
- Preprocessor directive
- Imports input/output functionality

🔹  `main()` 

- Program execution starts here
- OS calls main() automatically

🔹  `return 0;` 

- Signals successful execution to OS

---

## Preprocessor Directives & Macros

What is  `#include` ?

- Copies content of header file before compilation

### Header Files

- iostream → input/output
- cmath → math functions
- cstring → string functions

---

## Macros

 *`#define PI 3.14`* 

📌  **Why macros are used** 

- Constant values
- Faster replacement (no memory allocation)

---

## Identifiers & Keywords

Identifiers

Names given to:

- Variables
- Functions
- Classes

```cpp
int studentAge;
float averageMarks;

```

Rules

- Letters, digits, _ only
- Cannot start with digit
- No keywords
- Case-sensitive

### Naming Conventions

| Entity | Style |
| --- | --- |
| Variables | camelCase |
| Functions | camelCase |
| Classes | PascalCase |

### Keywords vs Identifiers

| Keywords | Identifiers |
| --- | --- |
| Reserved | User-defined |
| Define behavior | Name entities |
| int, while | count, sum |

---

## Input & Output (I/O)

Output –  `cout` 

```cpp
cout << "Hello";

```

- Uses insertion operator  "<<"
- Sends data to output stream

---

### Input –  `cin`

```cpp
int age;
cin >> age;

```

- Uses extraction operator ">>"
- Reads from keyboard → memory

📌  **Stream concept** 
Data flows like water:

- Keyboard → Memory ("cin")
- Memory → Screen ("cout")
