# C++ Introduction Part-1

## What is Programming?

 **Programming**  is the process of giving instructions to a computer to solve a problem or perform a task.

A computer itself is dumb—it only understands  **machine-level instructions** . Programming languages act as a  **bridge between human logic and machine execution** .

📌  **Real-life analogy** 
Think of programming like giving step-by-step cooking instructions.
If steps are wrong or unclear → dish fails.
Same with programs.

## What is C++?

 **C++**  is a  **general-purpose programming language**  developed by  **Bjarne Stroustrup**  as an extension of the C language.

It combines:

- Speed of low-level languages
- Abstraction of high-level languages
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

📌  **Why C++ still matters** 

- Gives full control over memory
- Extremely fast execution
- Used where performance is critical

## Features of C++

- High Performance (close to hardware)
- Object-Oriented (classes, objects, inheritance)
- Supports Procedural + OOP
- Manual Memory Control
- STL (Standard Template Library)

## Where is C++ Used?

### 🔹 Placements & Interviews

- Strong base language for DSA
- Common in product-based companies

### 🔹 Competitive Programming

- Fast I/O
- STL makes problem solving efficient

### 🔹 System Software

- Operating Systems
- Game Engines
- Compilers
- Databases

## Arithmetic Operators

Used to perform mathematical calculations

| Operator | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| + | Addition | a + b |
| - | Subtraction | a - b |
| * | Multiplication | a * b |
| / | Division | a / b |
| % | Modulus (remainder) | a % b |

```cpp
int a = 10, b = 3;
cout << a + b;

```

## Relational (Comparison) Operators

Used to compare two values and return  **true (1)**  or  **false (0)** .

| Operator | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| == | Equal to |
| != | Not equal to |
| > | Greater than |
| < | Less than |
| >= | Greater than or equal to |
| <= | Less than or equal to |

that is

## Logical Operators

Used to combine multiple conditions.

| Operator | Name |
| --- | --- |
| && | Logical AND |
| ! | Logical NOT |
