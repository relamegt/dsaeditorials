# Linear Search-2

## 

## 

## 1. What is Linear Search?

 **Linear Search**  (also called  **Sequential Search** ) is a simple searching algorithm that checks  **each element one by one**  in a list until:

- the target element is found, or
- the list ends.

It works on  **both sorted and unsorted arrays** .

## 2. Structure of a C++ Program

A basic C++ program has the following structure:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    cout << "Hello, World!";
    return 0;
}
```
```python
pythong
```
### Output
hello world

Explanation of Parts

| Part | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| #include <iostream> | Includes input-output library |
| using namespace std; | Allows use of standard names |
| int main() | Starting point of program |
| { } | Body of the program |
| return 0; | Ends the program |

## 2. How Linear Search Works

1. Start from the first element.
2. Compare the current element with the key.
3. If it matches → return the index.
4. If not → move to the next element.
5. If the end is reached → element not found

## 3. Algorithm (Steps)

 **Input:**  Array  `A` , size  `n` , search key  `x` 

 *for i = 0 to n-1
    if A[i] == x
        return i
return -1*

## 4. Time & Space Complexity

| Case | Time Complexity |
| --- | --- |
| Best Case | O(1) |
| Average Case | O(n) |
| Worst Case | O(n) |

### **Space Complexity:**  O(1)

## 5. Advantages & Disadvantages

### Advantages

- Very simple to implement
- Works on unsorted data
- No extra memory required

### Disadvantages

- Slow for large datasets
- Inefficient compared to binary search
